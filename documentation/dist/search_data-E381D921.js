Why use Kaisen Linux ?","doc":"Kaisen Linux aims to provide a comprehensive tool base for systems and network administrators, DevOps engineer, systems/network/security engineers etc, as well as to meet the needs of IT technicians with tools to perform many operations.\nIt was originally designed and built as a rescue system as its primary function, but finding it too \"classic and warmed up\", I decided to develop a wider and more extensive distribution than a \"simple\" rescue system with tools such as containerization, virtualization, diagnostic tools for network configurations and services such as DNS, etc.\nThis is why the slogan of distribution has gradually become \"The distribution for professional IT\". IT is a generic term widely used in France (the country of origin of Kaisen Linux) to designate technicians/administrators/systems and network engineers.\nI therefore combined tools intended for system and network administrators as well as technicians within the same distribution to meet the greatest number of needs. In small businesses, systems administrators are also computer technicians.\nThis allowed to extend the main function of system rescue, while providing diagnostic tools mainly for the network section.\nYou will find on this section, some arguments to distinguish it from other more or less similar projects.","ref":"why.html#kaisen-linux-objective"},{"type":"extras","title":"Base - Why use Kaisen Linux ?","doc":"Kaisen linux is based at Debian GNU/Linux (testing version) distribution.

The grub-btrfs package allows to boot on a previously created snapshot directly from the GRUB menu! All taken snapshots will can be restored from the started snapshot!  \n\nTo restore a snapshot, you should use the BTRFS commands or the commands or the commands of the software used to take the snapshots (Timeshift for example, also works with snapshots taken automatically by kaisen-timeshift-apt).  \n\nOn Kaisen Linux, the focus has been on Timeshift to automate the addition to the GRUB menu of BTRFS snapshots taken or deleted with Timeshift (also works with those taken with kaisen-timeshift-apt).  \n\nAll snapshots that are taken or deleted will be automatically added to the GRUB menu via a systemd service within 15 seconds! You don't have to do anything except manage your system as you wish!  \n\nWe therefore advise you to use Timeshift to create and manage your BTRFS snapshots.\n\n### Snapshots with Timeshift\nSnapshots with Timeshift, software available in CLI or GUI, the snapshots can be taken much more easily that with btrfs-progs commands.  \nWe recommend the use of Timeshift to take and restore snapshot of your system.  \n\nRemember to regularly delete your BTRFS snapshots taken with Timeshift, they can take up considerable space on your storage device.  \n\nThe timeshift manpage is available on Kaisen as well as all related documentation.\n\n### Restore snapshots from a chrooted environment\nIn case of a major crash (if your system does not boot), if the grub-btrfs software does not display anything, GRUB is not accessible, or an error has occurred, you can potentially recover your system from a [chrooted environment](create-chroot.html). There are many potential causes. In case of difficulties, the Kaisen Linux discussion groups or the official community forum can help you.\n\n## Recommendations for BTRFS\nThis is not enabled by default for performance reasons as well as to avoid premature wear, automated defragmentation is disabled.  \nIt is advisable to defragment BTRFS volumes at least every 6 months (CoW can create significant fragmentation), even on SSDs.  \nDelete the snapshots first, and then type the command (in case you have BTRFS installed on the root):  \n```sudo btrfs filesystem defragment -rv /```  \n\nYou can also use the btrfs-balance-least-used command to rebalance unbalanced pieces of data.

This therefore prevented the installation of your new graphical interface, and the old one was deleted, the next time you restart your machine, you would find yourself without a graphical interface.  \nSo I added as many checks as possible to limit the risk of losing the graphic interface during the process.
